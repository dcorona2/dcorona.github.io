 <h1>Beetles</h1>
 
 <h2>External Morphology</h2>
 <h3>Head</h3>
 <p>The head of a beetle has mouthparts that project forward or sometimes downwards, which are usually sclerotized and sometimes could be very large. The eyes are compound and are heavily adaptable to most situtations, with different beetles having unique traits to their eyes. The atennaes are primarily organs used for sensory perception and can detect motion, odor, nearby surroundings and chemical substances. The atennae can vary in form depending on the beetles sex and species.</p>
 <h3>Mouthparts</h3>
 <p>Beetles have mouthparts resembling those of grasshoppers. The mandibles are a pair of large, hard, tooth-like structures that can grasp, crush, or cut food or other insects. The two pairs of finger-like appendages known as the maxilary and labial palpi are found near the mouth in most beetles.</p>
 <h3>Thorax</h3>
 <p>The thorax is segmented into the two discernible parts, the pro- and pterothorax. When viewed from below, the thorax is that part from which all three pairs of legs and both pairs of wings arise. The abdomen is everything posterior to the thorax.[8] When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle section is a hard plate called the pronotum, which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's wings. This further segmentation is usually best seen on the abdomen.</p>
 <h3>Prothorax and Pterothorax</h3>
 <p>The pterothorax is the fused meso- and metathorax, which are commonly separated in other insect species, although flexibly articulate from the prothorax.</p>
 <h3>Legs</h3>
 <p>The multisegmented legs end in two to five small segments called tarsi. Like many other insect orders, beetles have claws, usually one pair, on the end of the last tarsal segment of each leg. While most beetles use their legs for walking, legs have been variously adapted for other uses.</p>
 <h3>Wings</h3>
 <p>The forewings of beetles are not used for flight, but form elytra which cover the hind part of the body and protect the hindwings. The elytra are usually hard shell-like structures which must be raised to allow the hindwings to move for flight. Beetles' flight wings are crossed with veins and are folded after landing, often along these veins, and stored below the elytra. A fold (jugum) of the membrane at the base of each wing is characteristic.</p>
 <h3>Abdomen</h3>
 <p>The abdomen is the section behind the metathorax, made up of a series of rings, each with a hole for breathing and respiration, called a spiracle, composing three different segmented sclerites: the tergum, pleura, and the sternum. The tergum in almost all species is membranous, or usually soft and concealed by the wings and elytra when not in flight. The pleura are usually small or hidden in some species, with each pleuron having a single spiracle. The sternum is the most widely visible part of the abdomen, being a more or less sclerotized segment.</p>
