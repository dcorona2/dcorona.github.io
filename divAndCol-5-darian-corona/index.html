    <p>Christmas is likely my favorite holiday. I dont like it just because of all the gifts, but rather the overall vibe and aesthetic of the festive season. Everything and everyone seem very peaceful and joyous during this holiday season. I also enjoy the music during this season, as everything is either very upbeat or calm in nature.</p>

    <h2 style="background-color:white; width:200px; color:rgb(59, 45, 45); font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Thanksgiving</h2>
    <p>Thanksgiving is my 2nd favorite holiday. One of the biggest factors is being with my family. I really enjoy being with family, likely due to me not really seeing other family members besides my parents and lil brother too often. I also enjoy the food, especially my mom's homemade mac-n-cheese.</p>

    <h2 style="background-color:white; width:150px; color:rgb(59, 45, 45); font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">4th of July</h2>
    <p>4th of july is often times a pretty good time. We usually go to our local TNT fireworks warehouse and buy a few fireworks. We would then light the fireworks later on in the night. Sometimes we'd go to a certain place that has fireworks being lit. Its overall a pretty fun time.</p>

    <h2 style="background-color:white; width:100px; color:rgb(59, 45, 45); font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Easter</h2>
    <p>There isnt really much to talk about when discussing Easter. Its just overall a pretty fun holiday. Sometimes, my family would go to a place that was hosting a massive Easter egg hunt. A memory that I fondly remember is when my parents hosted a massive Easter party at our local park. They invited many other family members and friends to enjoy the party. There was food being made, a giant bouncy castle, and a massive egg hunt throughout the park. Ever since that party, we haven't been celebrating Easter too often, which is a bit unfortunate.</p>

 <h2 style="background-color:white; width:150px; color:rgb(59, 45, 45); font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Halloween..</h2>
  <p>Halloween is my LEAST favorite holiday. I am not a horror person at all, and I just dont like the overall aesthetic of Halloween. I also don't eat candy or sweets, so I dont really care about trick or treating. Although, I do enjoy handing out candy to trick or treaters who happen to come to our door. Other than that, I really just dont like Halloween.</p>
