  <H1>1991: HTML 1.0</H1>
  
  <p>
  HTML 1.0 was first released to the public in 1993, but this version has a history that spans long before its official public release. In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee created HTML alongside the first web browser. In 1991, the first publicly available description of HTML was witin a document called "HTML tags." This document described the 18 original elements, with the most notable being the heading and paragraph tags.</p>

  <H1>1995: HTML 2.0</H1>
  <p>HTML 2.0 was first released in late 1995, and was published as RFC 1866 by the IETF. The goal for 2.0 was to create a standard for all browsers to follow, which would ensure that all pages would display more consistently across different platforms. This version introduced several things such as forms and tables. Despite these new additions, HTML 2.0 was still very limited as it was still text-based and lacked support for things such as videos and images.</p>
  <h1>1995-1997: HTML 3.0 - 3.2</h1>
  <p>HTML 3.0 was an incredibly ambitious version of HTML that began being developed sometime in 1995. This version planned on adding several complex and unique features that havent been seen before such as tables, text wrapping around images and support or complex mathematical formulas. However, due to how large and ambitious many of these proposed features were, HTML 3.0 never saw the light of day and its features would be used for future versions such as HTML 3.2 in 1997.</p>
<h1>1998: HTML 4.0</h1>
<p>HTML 4.0 was first released as a W3C recommendation in late 1997, and was soon revised in early 1998. This version introduced several brand new and significant features such as support to CSS, frames (allowed the division of a webpage to several sections), and many more. Eventually, HTML 4.01 was released in 1999 as a way of improving several aspects of HTML 4.0 that were introduced.</p>
<h1>2014: HTML 5.0</h1>
<p>The latest and current version of HTML that released in 2014. This version made massive improvements compared to previous versions. This version improved and introduced several things such as better multimedia support (allowing video and audio elements to be officially supported without the need of plugins), graphic elements such as canvas and svg, offline storage, drag and drop functionality and many more features. HTML 5.0 has been the current main version of HTML for more than a decade at this point and has improved the development of web pages all across the world wide web.</p>
<h1>EXTRA: XHTML</h1>
<p>XHTML (short for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) was created as a much more stricter, cleaner and robust version of HTML 4.01. XHTML was intended to bridge the gap between HTMl and the then emerging XML ecosystem. Development of XHTML eventually was abandoned in 2009 as resources were instead used to develop the up and coming HTML 5.0.</p>
