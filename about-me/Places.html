            <h3>Gathering Place</h3>
            <section>
                <p>The Gathering Place is a really cool park, so that is why I decided to add it to this page. I have a lot of memories with the Gathering Place, with the earliest being about a fieldtrip my school took that allowed us to enter the park early. It is crazy seeing how much the park has developed over the years. </p>
