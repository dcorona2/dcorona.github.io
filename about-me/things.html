 <p>This website has no overarching theme, so I've basically been talking about random things I find interesting or cool. I think these little water gadgets are pretty cool. They are very fun to use, especially when your trying to get the colorful rings onto the poles. There are also other versions of this water game thing like the basketball one seen in the image above. Anyways I should probably stop rambling, after all I did get at least 3 sentences within this paragraph</p>
