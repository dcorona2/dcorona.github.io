                <p>Hey there, the name is Darian and I am in the 9th Grade. One of my favorite things to do is to draw. I really like drawing, in fact, I have been drawing for almost my entire life. I just really enjoy drawing because it allows me to express my thoughts into the drawings that I create. It's also just really fun to make silly creatures. </p>
                <p>I also have quite a few pets. I have had a lot of pets throughout my life, but I currently have 4 dogs. 3 of these dogs are French Bulldogs while 1 one of them is a Yorkie Poodle. They are really energetic (except the Yorkie Poodle, for he is 11 years old.)</p>
